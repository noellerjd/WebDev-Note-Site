            This is just a basic website I threw together to track my notes in a
            way that also allowed me to practice some of what I'm learning first
            hand!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This way I don't have to flip through pages and try to work with my
            horrible hand writing when I need to look up some of my notes!

            <u>Hypertext:</u> Pieces of text that link to other pieces of text
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Markup Language:</u> Marks what attributes the text should have,
            ie. Bold, Italic, Underline, etc. &lt;H1&gt;
          </p>
          <h3 class="topic">What are my goals?</h3>
          <p>
            <u>1.) Why do I want to learn this skill?</u> I love computers, and
            I love to create. If I can combine these two passions to do
            something that would make me a living and allow me to do what I
            love-- it would be amazing!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>2.) What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</u> Ideally, a
            more fulfilling career but also amazing feeling that I've followed
            through with learning something.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>3.) How will this skill my life and career?</u> I would love to
            see this create more opportunities for me and make my life more
            enjoyable with enough money to be able to survive!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>4.) How will learning this impact the lives of my family?</u> I
            would love it if this took some of the stress off of my wife and
            also I would love to be able to buy my corgi, Einstein, more toys
            and more room to run around!!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>5.) How will I feel if I accomplish this?</u> I will feel OVER
            THE MOON. I would great to feel the enjoyment that comes with
            mastering a skill or at least focusing enough to see it through.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>6.) What would my life look like if I accomplish this?</u>
            Hopefully less stress, car issues, and less worrying about my life
            in general! Maybe a house to make payments on and more rooms (with
            maybe less noisy neigbors)!
          </p>
          <h3>List Items</h3>
          <p>
            <u>Unordered Lists:</u> Orders lists with bullet points, example
            below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unordered list item 1</li>
            <li>Unordered list item 2</li>

          </ol>
          <h3>Nesting and Indentation</h3>
          <p>
            You can nest &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; within each other to make a
            more detailed list which could look like:

          <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/3/24</p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <u>Element Selectors:</u> allows you to apply styles to all of a
            certain tag in your html. <br />Such as p{font-size:3rem;}
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Attribute Selectors:</u> selects elements with a certain
            attribute. p[draggable]{color:blue;} will only effect p tags with
            the draggable attribute.<br />
            You can also select their value inversely by doing something like
            p[draggable="false"]{color:blue;}, which will only effect p tags
            that have their draggable attribute set to false.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Universal Selector:</u> * using an astrisk you can select
            everything and apply a style universally. <br />Such as *
            {font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;}
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>ID Selector:</u> allows you to style a specific element with a
            set ID. Usually this is for elements that won't be used more than
            once, such as a header or footer, etc. It will look something like
            this<br />#header{background-color:white;}
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Class Selector:</u> allows you to style a specific element with a
            set class. Usually this is for elements that you will be repeating,
            so you can apply style to the class that will automatically apply to
            everything with this class, such as wanting to apply underlines to
            every p with the class="underlined" and would look like this: <br />
            .underlined{font-decoration: underline;}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="font-properties" class="notes-card">
          <h2>Font Properties</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/3/24</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Font Size</h3>
          <p>
            <u>1px:</u> meaning 1 pixel or 1/96th and inch, about the size of a
            pixel.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>1pt:</u> meaning 1 point or 1/72nd of an inch. Typically used in
            word processors like Microsoft Word or Gmail/Outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>1em:</u> literally meaning the size of an M, the widest letter in
            the alphabet. 1m would be 100% of the parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>1rem:</u> meaning root em. This would be relative to the root of
            the HTML instead of the parent. 1rem = ~20px
          </p>
          <h3>Text Align</h3>
          <p>
            **Apologies if this throws you off, I styled each to represent how
            they would look in actual code.**
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            <u>Center:</u> centers text in the middle of their parent.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            <u>Left:</u> aligns text to the left of their parent.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: right">
            <u>Right:</u> aligns text to the right of their parent.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: start">
            <u>Start:</u> aligns text to the start of their parent, depending on
            the language it's coded. Left in english.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: end">
            <u>End:</u> aligns text to the end of their parent, depending on the
            language it's coded. Right for english.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            <u>Justify:</u> lines up text to align the structure of text to be
            the starting edge and the ending edge, and should space the text
            dynamically to make this happen for everything except the last word.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="intermediate-css" class="notes-card">
          <h2>Intermediate CSS</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/4/24</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/waterfall-drawing.jpg"
              alt="Image of a waterfall with mutiple levels"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Position:</u> CSS will read top to bottom, so one selector at the
            bottom will be the final one applied, for example if you have two
            attribute selectors both referencing line items:
          </p>
          <p>li {color:red} <--- this one is read first</p>
          <p>li {color:blue} <--- this one is read second.</p>
          <p>
            The last one to be read will be applied, therfore the line items
            would be blue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Specificity:</u> CSS will prioritize specifity over position, for
            example any style that refrences a class will override any element
            selectors. Any ID selectors will take priority over class selectors.
            Any attribute selectors will also override class selectors but won't
            override ID selectors. See image below:
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/css-specificity.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes of the order in which the CSS will prioritize selectors"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Type:</u> CSS will prioritize linked stylesheets last. Higher on
            priority is the HTML contained CSS (the styling you do in the
            &lt;head&gt; of the html document). The highest priority is styling
            done withing the physical tags of the HTML such as &lt;li
            style="color:red"&gt;
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/type-notes.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes of the order in which the CSS will prioritize types of css"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>!Important:</u> this is a keyword you can apply to any rule ie.
            p{color:green !important;} this will give the styling highest
            priority no matter what.
          </p>
          <h3>Alternate Selectors</h3>
          <p>
            <u>Grouping Selectors:</u> h1, h2{color:blueviolet;} will group two
            different selectors with the same styling. In this case both h1s and
            h2s will become blueviolet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Child Selectors:</u> .box > p {color:firebrick} can be used to
            select a direct child of an element. In this case any p tags that
            are children of something with the "box" class will change their
            color to firebrick
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Descendant Selector:</u> .box li{color:blue} or selector
            selector{color:blue}. These will apply css to the descendant of the
            left selector, in example the li that is a sescendant of something
            with the "box" class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Chaining Selector:</u> SelectorSelector{color:seagreen} or
            h1#tile.big.heading{color:seagreen;}. A chaining selector is a very
            specific way to apply styles to an element, there should be no
            spaces when using this selector and element selectors must always go
            first.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Combining Combiners:</u> Selector
            SelectorSelector{font-size:0.5rem;} or ul p.done{font-size:0.5rem}.
            This is a way to select a more specific element for styling in css.
            In the example, we are selecting a p element with the class of done
            but only if it's a descendant of a ul element.
          </p>
          <h3>CSS Positioning</h3>
          <p>There are four different values for positioning.</p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img long-img"
              src="./assets/css-positioning-note.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes of examples of positioning in css"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Static Positioning:</u> HTML's default flow. item flows as it
            would in the actual html file. Displayed below the code above it by
            default.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Relative Positioning:</u> Item positioned relative to it's
            default position. Changing the items position would be relative to
            it's supposed position.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Absolute Positioning:</u> Sets item's position to nearest
            <b>positioned</b> anscestor, or top left corner of the webpage. If
            the ancestor doesn't have a position set, the second rule becomes
            true.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Fixed Positioning:</u> Positions relative to the top left corner
            of the browser. This won't change even when scrolling up or down on
            the webpage and will always remain visable by default. This is what
            I used to have the menu on desktop stay no matter where the user
            scrolls in this webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i
              >- a lot of the time you will see a parent set to relative and the
              child set to absolute</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Z-index:</u> determines which element is displayed over another
            element if applicable. Values for the z-index must be a positive or
            negative integer, but can range all the way to ±2147483647.
