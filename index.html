          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This is just a basic website I threw together to track my notes in a
            way that also allowed me to practice some of what I'm learning first
            hand!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This way I don't have to flip through pages and try to work with my
            horrible hand writing when I need to look up some of my notes!

            <u>Hypertext:</u> Pieces of text that link to other pieces of text
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Markup Language:</u> Marks what attributes the text should have,
            ie. Bold, Italic, Underline, etc. &lt;H1&gt;
          </p>
          <h3 class="topic">What are my goals?</h3>
          <p>
            <u>1.) Why do I want to learn this skill?</u> I love computers, and
            I love to create. If I can combine these two passions to do
            something that would make me a living and allow me to do what I
            love-- it would be amazing!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>2.) What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</u> Ideally, a
            more fulfilling career but also amazing feeling that I've followed
            through with learning something.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>3.) How will this skill my life and career?</u> I would love to
            see this create more opportunities for me and make my life more
            enjoyable with enough money to be able to survive!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>4.) How will learning this impact the lives of my family?</u> I
            would love it if this took some of the stress off of my wife and
            also I would love to be able to buy my corgi, Einstein, more toys
            and more room to run around!!
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>5.) How will I feel if I accomplish this?</u> I will feel OVER
            THE MOON. I would great to feel the enjoyment that comes with
            mastering a skill or at least focusing enough to see it through.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>6.) What would my life look like if I accomplish this?</u>
            Hopefully less stress, car issues, and less worrying about my life
            in general! Maybe a house to make payments on and more rooms (with
            maybe less noisy neigbors)!
          </p>
          <h3>List Items</h3>
          <p>
            <u>Unordered Lists:</u> Orders lists with bullet points, example
            below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unordered list item 1</li>
            <li>Unordered list item 2</li>

          </ol>
          <h3>Nesting and Indentation</h3>
          <p>
            You can nest &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; within each other to make a
            more detailed list which could look like:

          <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/3/24</p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <u>Element Selectors:</u> allows you to apply styles to all of a
            certain tag in your html. <br />Such as p{font-size:3rem;}
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Attribute Selectors:</u> selects elements with a certain
            attribute. p[draggable]{color:blue;} will only effect p tags with
            the draggable attribute.<br />
            You can also select their value inversely by doing something like
            p[draggable="false"]{color:blue;}, which will only effect p tags
            that have their draggable attribute set to false.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Universal Selector:</u> * using an astrisk you can select
            everything and apply a style universally. <br />Such as *
            {font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;}
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>ID Selector:</u> allows you to style a specific element with a
            set ID. Usually this is for elements that won't be used more than
            once, such as a header or footer, etc. It will look something like
            this<br />#header{background-color:white;}
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Class Selector:</u> allows you to style a specific element with a
            set class. Usually this is for elements that you will be repeating,
            so you can apply style to the class that will automatically apply to
            everything with this class, such as wanting to apply underlines to
            every p with the class="underlined" and would look like this: <br />
            .underlined{font-decoration: underline;}
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="font-properties" class="notes-card">
          <h2>Font Properties</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/3/24</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Font Size</h3>
          <p>
            <u>1px:</u> meaning 1 pixel or 1/96th and inch, about the size of a
            pixel.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>1pt:</u> meaning 1 point or 1/72nd of an inch. Typically used in
            word processors like Microsoft Word or Gmail/Outlook.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>1em:</u> literally meaning the size of an M, the widest letter in
            the alphabet. 1m would be 100% of the parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>1rem:</u> meaning root em. This would be relative to the root of
            the HTML instead of the parent. 1rem = ~20px
          </p>
          <h3>Text Align</h3>
          <p>
            **Apologies if this throws you off, I styled each to represent how
            they would look in actual code.**
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            <u>Center:</u> centers text in the middle of their parent.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            <u>Left:</u> aligns text to the left of their parent.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: right">
            <u>Right:</u> aligns text to the right of their parent.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: start">
            <u>Start:</u> aligns text to the start of their parent, depending on
            the language it's coded. Left in english.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: end">
            <u>End:</u> aligns text to the end of their parent, depending on the
            language it's coded. Right for english.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            <u>Justify:</u> lines up text to align the structure of text to be
            the starting edge and the ending edge, and should space the text
            dynamically to make this happen for everything except the last word.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="intermediate-css" class="notes-card">
          <h2>Intermediate CSS</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/4/24</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/waterfall-drawing.jpg"
              alt="Image of a waterfall with mutiple levels"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Position:</u> CSS will read top to bottom, so one selector at the
            bottom will be the final one applied, for example if you have two
            attribute selectors both referencing line items:
          </p>
          <p>li {color:red} <--- this one is read first</p>
          <p>li {color:blue} <--- this one is read second.</p>
          <p>
            The last one to be read will be applied, therfore the line items
            would be blue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Specificity:</u> CSS will prioritize specifity over position, for
            example any style that refrences a class will override any element
            selectors. Any ID selectors will take priority over class selectors.
            Any attribute selectors will also override class selectors but won't
            override ID selectors. See image below:
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/css-specificity.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes of the order in which the CSS will prioritize selectors"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Type:</u> CSS will prioritize linked stylesheets last. Higher on
            priority is the HTML contained CSS (the styling you do in the
            &lt;head&gt; of the html document). The highest priority is styling
            done withing the physical tags of the HTML such as &lt;li
            style="color:red"&gt;
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/type-notes.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes of the order in which the CSS will prioritize types of css"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>!Important:</u> this is a keyword you can apply to any rule ie.
            p{color:green !important;} this will give the styling highest
            priority no matter what.
          </p>
          <h3>Alternate Selectors</h3>
          <p>
            <u>Grouping Selectors:</u> h1, h2{color:blueviolet;} will group two
            different selectors with the same styling. In this case both h1s and
            h2s will become blueviolet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Child Selectors:</u> .box > p {color:firebrick} can be used to
            select a direct child of an element. In this case any p tags that
            are children of something with the "box" class will change their
            color to firebrick
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Descendant Selector:</u> .box li{color:blue} or selector
            selector{color:blue}. These will apply css to the descendant of the
            left selector, in example the li that is a sescendant of something
            with the "box" class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Chaining Selector:</u> SelectorSelector{color:seagreen} or
            h1#tile.big.heading{color:seagreen;}. A chaining selector is a very
            specific way to apply styles to an element, there should be no
            spaces when using this selector and element selectors must always go
            first.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Combining Combiners:</u> Selector
            SelectorSelector{font-size:0.5rem;} or ul p.done{font-size:0.5rem}.
            This is a way to select a more specific element for styling in css.
            In the example, we are selecting a p element with the class of done
            but only if it's a descendant of a ul element.
          </p>
          <h3>CSS Positioning</h3>
          <p>There are four different values for positioning.</p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img long-img"
              src="./assets/css-positioning-note.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes of examples of positioning in css"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Static Positioning:</u> HTML's default flow. item flows as it
            would in the actual html file. Displayed below the code above it by
            default.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Relative Positioning:</u> Item positioned relative to it's
            default position. Changing the items position would be relative to
            it's supposed position.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Absolute Positioning:</u> Sets item's position to nearest
            <b>positioned</b> anscestor, or top left corner of the webpage. If
            the ancestor doesn't have a position set, the second rule becomes
            true.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Fixed Positioning:</u> Positions relative to the top left corner
            of the browser. This won't change even when scrolling up or down on
            the webpage and will always remain visable by default. This is what
            I used to have the menu on desktop stay no matter where the user
            scrolls in this webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i
              >- a lot of the time you will see a parent set to relative and the
              child set to absolute</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Z-index:</u> determines which element is displayed over another
            element if applicable. Values for the z-index must be a positive or
            negative integer, but can range all the way to ±2147483647.

            the width of the browser. Inline elements will default to the width
            of their contetns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Inline Block:</u> <b>display:inline-block;</b> The block portion
            of this display property allows us to set the height and width of
            the item. The inline portion allows us to have elements that go on
            the same line.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>None: </u> <b>display: none;</b> This will make the element
            dissapear from the webpage.
          </p>
          <h3>CSS Float</h3>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <i>"wrapping text using float and clear"</i>
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Float Property:</u> <b>float:left; float:right;</b> This allows
            elements (such as an image) to be take out of the normal flow of the
            webpage and wraps the rest of the page around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Clear Property:</u>
            <b>clear:left; clear:right; clear:both;</b> Allows elements to be
            exempt from other floating elements ie. used to exclude a footer
            from a floating element to keep the footer at the bottom of the
            page.
          </p>
          <h3>Responsive Websites</h3>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <i
              >Using tools to make websites functional on <b>ALL</b> devices.</i
            >
          </div>
          <p>
            <u>Media Query:</u>
            <b>@media(max-width:600px){*css for screens 600px wide or less*}</b>
            can be used to change styling for users on different width devices
            like tablets and phones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Min-width will do the inverse of max width. You can also combine
            breakpoints to target screen sizes more specifically, ie.
            <b>@media(min-width:600px) and (max-width:900px){color:blue}</b> in
            this example screens that are 600px or higher and 900px or lower
            will have the text color be blue. This is used in order to design
            styles for a specific screen size, like a tablet or phone. You can
            also inverse the min and max to exclude styling on a specific screen
            size.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also specify styles for different screen orientations, ie.
            <b>@media screen(orientation:landscape){color:red}</b> to change
            styles for only landscape or portrait modes.
          </p>
          <p><u>Typical Screen Size Ranges:</u></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mobile Devices: 319px - 480px</li>
            <li>Tablets: 481px - 1200px</li>
            <li>Laptops: 1200px - 1600px</li>
            <li>Desktops: 1600px+</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <u>CSS Grid:</u> You can use a grid format to complete the layout by
            creating a div with a class like "grid-container" followed by
            specific card layouts within the container and set the display to
            <b>display:grid;</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            You can then use <b>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;</b> for example
            to specify two columns. 1fr meaning 1 fraction, splitting these
            columns into two rows of the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can then use <b>grid-template-rows</b> similarly to specify how
            many rows to display. This can be done in the same way with 1fr or
            you can alternatively set a pixel height, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using this method you can also set a gap between the rows and
            columns by using <b>gap: 30px;</b> for example, to specify a 30px
            gap between each row.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wanted one column to span two rows (for a header or larger
            column for example) you can make the class something like: "first
            card" so it'll still retain the card class but then with .first you
            can specify <b>grid-column:span 2;</b> or <b>grid-row:span 2;</b> in
            order to expand the card with the class .first to be the width of
            two columns or rows, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>CSS Flexbox</u> Similar to the grid system which is good for 2D
            design, flexbox is good for 1D design; changing items to apply to
            vertical or horizontal styling.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use <b>display:flex;</b> on a parent div to then apply
            <b>flex:1;</b> to all children to let all flexible children be the
            same length regardless of its content. You can alternatively change
            the distribution of each child by changing their flex value.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would still be similar in some ways to the grid style, using
            containers and cards, but would be more visually complex and
            responsive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Bootstrap Frameworks:</u> This is a method that uses frameworks
            pre-coded by other programmers to cut the css down and has different
            rules for different selectors that are applied by putting in
            different key words into your classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bootstrap for example also has it's own system for putting in
            responsive design, ie. <b>class="col-4"</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically the sight is divided into 12 sections and by using
            <b>col-4</b> it will take up 4/12 of a section, or 1/3 of the
            webpage. They will respond based on how much of the fraction of the
            webpage they take up.
          </p>
          <h3>Best Practice</h3>
          <p>
            Designing layouts was first mainly done by using the
            <b>table method</b>, which is very much a no-no when it comes to
            design nowadays.
          </p>
          <p>
            This then evloved to the <b>display tool</b> in CSS (<b
              >display:inline-block; etc.</b
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            This turned out to still be funky to work with which is why
            eventually they moved onto the <b>float tool</b>
            <b>(float:left; float:right; float:both)</b> and while this is still
            in use to float certain elements, back then they found that they
            could actually design the website using the float tool but still had
            a lot of flaws. Hence why it's best to use:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="css-flexbox" class="notes-card">
          <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
          <p class="date">Date: 2/6/24</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Flex Box</h3>
          <p>
            <u>Display:flex;</u> is completely different from inline, block,
            etc. It no longer abides by these rules once used. When we give an
            item <b>display:flex;</b> we give some control to flexbox to allow
            it to display the code in a reasonable and commonly desired way.
            With flexbox we have a lot of modifiers to tweak it to achive the
            look we're going for
          </p>
          <p>
            Flex box ignores any pre-defined rule (<b
              >display:block; display:inline; etc.</b
            >) and instead wants to put everything together based on the content
            within the element to fit them. That being said you can still use
            the <b>gap:30px</b> for example to put space between the elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Display: inline-flex;</u> this will try to make your flexbox able
            to be next to another element or flexbox; similar to a wider
            reaching inline. This will force the elements to only take up as
            much width as the widest tag, it's the same as flex but
            horizontally.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              class="demo-img"
              src="./assets/inline-flex-example.jpg"
              alt="Photo from my own notes trying to visually display how inline flex would look"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Flex Direction</h3>
          <p>
            By default the flex direction is set to: <b>row</b>. So the items
            within the flexbox will align horizonally. When set to row, this is
            called the <b>Main Axis</b>. Alternatively, the opposite axis is
            called the <b>Cross Axis</b>. If the flex direction is set to row,
            the cross axis would be vertical. The opposite is true if the flex
            direction is set to: <b>column</b>. ie.
            <b>flex-direction: column; flex-direction: row;</b> <br />
            You can also set them to be in reverse, ie.
            <b
              >flex-direction: row-reverse; and flex-direction:
              column-reverse;</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Flex-basis:</u> The flex basis will expand the flex box along the
            main axis to satisfy the flex-basis requirement. Up and down if
            direction is set to column, left and right if direction is set to
            row. For this to work, flex-basis <i>must</i> be set on the
            children, not the parent.
          </p>
          <h3>Flexible Layout</h3>
          <p>
            <u>flex-wrap: </u> by default if the flexbox runs out of room it
            wont automatically move to the next line. You can change this from
            it's default flex-wrap: nowrap; to flex-wrap: wrap; to have it move
            items without room to the next line. This is a property that is set
            on the parent, not the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>flex-flow: </u> is a way to combine both the flex-direction and
            flex-wrap in one line as they are often used together. ie.
            <b>flex-flow: row wrap;</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Order: </u> with a flexbox, by default everything has an order of
            0, you can adjust an item and set it's order:1; for example and if
            everything else is still at the default "0", then the set item will
            appear last in the flexbox. You can set order:" "; to integer and it
            must be set on the child, not the parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>justify-content:</u> sets the distribution of items within a
            flexbox along the main axis. you can use
            <b>justify-content: flex-start</b> to have the items line up from
            the left or the start of the flexbox, inversely you can use
            <b>justify-content: flex-end;</b> for the opposite effect (as long
            as there's room within the flexbox to change this)
            <b>justify-content: center</b> will make the items gravitate toward
            the center of the flex box.
            <b>justify-content: space-between</b> will allow you to have each
            item spaced to take up the entire width of the flexbox-- adding gaps
            between items to make this happen.
            <b>justify-content: space-evenly</b> will line the items up to make
            the items line up evenly from the center of the flexbox to take up
            the width of the flexbox. <b>justify-conter: space-around</b> will
            distribute items evenly and make the start and end gaps half the
            size of the space between each item.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Align Items:</u> is very similar to justify-content except it
            will alter the items on the cross-axis. Unlike justify-content, for
            align-items to work you'll need to set the height of the container,
            and works best if the flex-wrap is set to nowrap. You can still use
            similar values for the styling as you did with justify-content such
            as, flex-start; flex-end; center; but can also use align-items:
            stretch; to have the items take up the entire cross axis of the
            flex-box. This is set on the parent, not the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>align-self: </u> allows you to set the alignment of a singular
            item within the flexbox by assigning it on the child you want to
            affect. You can still use similar values for the styling as you did
            with justify-content and align-items such as, flex-start; flex-end;
            center;
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>align-content:</u> align-content is similar to align items except
            it's made to work with flexbox's that are set to wrap, instead of
            nowrap. You can still use similar values for the styling as you did
            with justify-content and align-items such as, flex-start; flex-end;
            center; This is set on the parent, not the child.
